@learner Hi everyone!

We are entering **week 16** of the Kotlin Developer program

It is the start of the Sprint 5, with focus on an extremely essential area for developers: **Testing and debugging** :beetle:

*What would you do:*
:small_blue_diamond: Practice code formatting and debugging, how to find bugs and fix memory leak
:small_blue_diamond: Get an understanding of unit testing and JUnit as a tool
:small_blue_diamond: Learn about profiling and garbage collection.

There is a new project: **Bug Busters (Kotlin)**

:octagonal_sign: This project is quite complex and has a lot of new prerequisites. Please, donâ€™t forget to ask questions if you face any difficulties while reading the topics or completing the project stages.

Check the details on our [Notion page](https://wobbly-purpose-4f5.notion.site/Kotlin-Backend-Developer-Career-program-starts-January-2025-17c5fc6219ac80aba497f76f4fe54b29)
